Our first project at Cerebrum Hub was: “Food Ordering App”. Customer was Bella’s Pizzeria and they only had one physical restaurant where they were making authentic pizzas based on their own unique recipes.

Project objectives: Decrease number of physical contacts using remote ordering system; Record and secure customers data to comply with GDPR and data privacy laws; Store customers data for 21 days according to the government demands. 

Main functionalities: Contactless ordering; Using only a QR code or web address to order; Browsing menu and ordering; Restaurant managers have simple product management; Securely record customer data that meets privacy law.

Non-functional requirements: Web application is accessible from mobile phones, tablets and computers; All modern browsers must be supported (e.g. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Chrome on Android or IOS); Customer data only accessible in a secure way.

Our team’s mission was to build testing checklists in Confluence for all functionalities and report any bugs to Jira. Functionalities were divided between 2 sprints. Out of 40 bug reports from my team, I did 18. After that we had to perform regression testing and prepare a final bug report.

My mission was to build a testing checklist for UC2. Previewing products and with a team member I did a checklist for: UC1. Menu browsing with search. Checklists were done for both, positive and negative scenarios (for example, what happens when someone orders 200 pizzas and 500 Coca-Colas at the same time, is it even possible, etc.) 

Also, in the second sprint I was the sprint coordinator which means I coordinated all the team meetings (sprint planning session, stand-up meetings, RAP meetings, assign all responsibilities). I had to check that everyone does their part and find out the problems that others are facing. It was also important to check that everything was done by the deadline (and done correctly) and check that all the bugs reported in Jira are presented in the final bug report which I also did in Confluence.

Our team was victorious, leading to 100% result in project 1, both individually and team-based.
